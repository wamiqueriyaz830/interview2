    <ul>
        <h4>Q1.What is React? What are its features</h4>
        <li>A.React was created by Jordane Walke,a software engineer at facebook in the year 2011 and
            it was deployed first at the facebook newsfeed and later it was used in facebook and instagram.
            React is a open source frontend js library.
            It follows the component based approach for building reusable UI component specially for single page
            application
            abd it is used for developing interactive view layer of web and mobile application.

        <li>featuresof React-Virtual Dom</li>
        <li>
            one way data binding
        </li>
        <li>reusablecomponent</li>
        <li>JSX(Javascript syntax Extension)</li>
        <li>Performance</li>
        <h4>Q.Explain Virtual Dom</h4>
        <li> DOM is a document object model, created by converting HTML CSS and JS Real DOM,
            which is an object which gets created whenever any React application gets loaded on the screen for the first
            time.
            <li>whenever React components gets mounted on the screen for the first time.</li>
            <li>Now when any user makes any changes on the screen like button click because of which the state variable will
            get updated so in this case the changes will not directly go to Real DOM , instead in react we have concept
            known Virtual DOM.</li> 
            <li>So we are having two virtual doms, one virtual dom gets created at the time of mounting
            of react component so it is a copy of your real dom.</li>
             <li>Another virtual dom is the dom which contains the new changes,updated state variables values. Now these two virtual doms will get compared with each other and will check
            for the new changes.
            <li>This complete procedure is known as diffing algorithm. Now the new changes will be updated in your Real dom.
            this procedure is known as Recoinciliation.</li>
            <h4>REact vs Angular vs Vue</h4>
            <li>
                Library is a set of reusablefunctions used by computer program and framework is a piece of code that dictates the architecture of a project,code calls the library bt in framework call the code.</li>
                <li>In library we can control the dat flow bt methods but in framework we dont haev any control of the data flow,framework decides how the data will flow that is nothing but frameworks calls the code,</li>
                <li>and in performance wise react is having higher performanceover angular and vue and community support and also react is having the easy learning curve and it hs having SPA(single page application).
            </li>
            <h4>What is the difference between Class Component and Functional Component</h4>
            <li>In Class component use lifecycles method where as in functional component have hooks</li>
            <li>Functional components are also called stateless component while class component is called statefull component and there is no render function.</li>
            <li>In functional component returns value.and it accepts props as an argument but props and state can use in class components.</li>
            <li>Functional componentsare easy o read bt where in class component it is hard to read and have complex code structure.</li>
            <li>In class component we use the "this " keyword bt in class we don't use.</li>
            <h4>Statefull and Stateless component</h4>
            <li>Stateless component doesn't hold or manage state bt statefull component hold and can manage state.Stateless is simple and easy to understand where as statefull component it is complex as compare to the stateless componen</li>
            <li>Stateless component doesn't work with react lifecycles but where as statefull work with any hooks</li>
            <li>Stateless cann't be used bt statefull component we can use with the useState hooks</li>
            <li>Stateless component also known as functional component and statefull is a class component.</li>
            <h4>What are the different phases of React componentâ€™s lifecycle?</h4>
            <li>1. Intial Phase 2.Mounting 3.Updating 4.Unmounting </li>
            <li>In ReactJS, every component creation process involves various lifecycle methods. These lifecycle methods are termed as component's lifecycle. These lifecycle methods are not very complicated and called at various points during a component's life. The lifecycle of the component is divided into four phases. They are:
                1.	Initial Phase
                2.	Mounting Phase
                3.	Updating Phase
                4.	Unmounting Phase
                Each phase contains some lifecycle methods that are specific to the particular phase
                </li>

        
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <li>SPA vs MPA</li>
    <ul>
        <li>In terms of performance SPA not need the reloading so giving higher performance and responsiveness while SPA is slow and performance is affected by reloading. </li>
        <li>Acc to coding-wise SPA has reusable code for single page application while MPA need coding from scratch hence no place for reusability</li>
        <li>Acc to maintenance SPA is having fast and easy maintenance while in MPA the mainetenance need to be done for each page.</li>
        <li>Acc to SEO the SPA is having limited optimization while MPA has several optimization</li>
        <li>Acc to user experience the SPA is very smooth and friendly while in MPA has worse user experience</li>
        <li>No loading time is required in SPA while it takes ages if the connection is slow.</li>
        <li>Acc to security we have to secure the endpoint while the MPA need each page to be secured saparately </li>
    </ul>
    <li>State vs Props</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Props are read-only.	State changes can be asynchronous.</li>
        <li>Props are immutable.	State is mutable.</li>
        <li>Props allow you to pass data from one component to other components as an argument.	State holds information about the components.</li>
        <li>Props can be accessed by the child component.	State cannot be accessed by child components.</li>
        <li>Props are used to communicate between components.	States can be used for rendering dynamic changes with the component.</li>
        <li>Stateless component can have Props.	Stateless components cannot have State.</li>
        <li>Props make components reusable.	State cannot make components reusable.</li>
        <li>Props are external and controlled by whatever renders the component.	The State is internal and controlled by the React Component itself.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Props Drilling and state uplifting</li>
    Prop drilling is basically a situation when the same data is being sent at almost every level due to requirements in the final level. 
    <br><br>
    every component in React has its own state. Because of this sometimes data can be redundant and inconsistent. So, by Lifting up the state we make the state of the parent component as a single source of truth and pass the data of the parent in its children.
